## 🖥️ Main Project Description
The primary focus of this project is the **academic study and exploration of the iOS operating system**.

Due to **architectural and platform-level restrictions**, the iOS operating system does not support direct installation on non-Apple hardware. As a result, **Apple’s official iOS Simulator** was utilized as a **technically and academically accepted virtual environment** for analyzing iOS system behavior, interface structure, and operating system functionality.

## 🧪 Virtualization Environment
- **Tool Used:** Apple iOS Simulator  
- **Purpose:** Academic analysis of iOS operating system behavior  
- **Justification:** Official Apple-provided solution for iOS system exploration where direct installation is not supported

## 📂 Repository Contents
- 📄 **iOS Operating System Project Documentation** (PDF)
- 📱 **Assignment 1:** Mobile Phone Brand Evaluation *(Emporia)*
- 💻 **Assignment 2:** PC Brand Evaluation *(Dell EMC)*

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered
- Operating system structure and functionality
- Virtualization concepts: purpose, benefits, and limitations
- Mobile and desktop operating system environments
- Hardware and operating system compatibility
- Technical evaluation and comparative analysis

---

## ⚠️ Academic Clarification
The use of the **iOS Simulator** complies with academic standards and is considered an appropriate method for studying iOS operating system behavior in environments where direct installation is **technically or legally restricted**.

---

## 🎓 Conclusion
This project provided structured exposure to operating system principles, virtualization methodologies, and platform evaluation techniques. The assignments further reinforced analytical skills and practical understanding of system behavior across different computing environments.
